# Machine-Learning

Here are my experiments with machine learning datasets, usually I pick them up from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/aniruddha001

#1) digit recogniition - top 83%, 96 % accuracy
 - importing the data
 - split it into X and y
 - split it into train and test
 - standardize the X_test and y_test
 - fit the data using kernel SVM = 'rbf'
 - predict
 - create confusion matrix and print accuracy
 - import test data
 - standardize it using the same object
 - predict
 - create csv with ImageID and Label as header
